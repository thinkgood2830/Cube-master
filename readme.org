* Cube
- music is back once Renderer's OnSurfacePickedListener was set properly. 
- but due to lack of rest, I am so sick of the mediaplayer states now. Will work on 3d tetris implementation in the evening after some rest, and come back to work on this one some other time when my mind is clear. 
- Game flow through, debugging, onpick listener back now, needs to get my music back. nothing difficult, should be able to finish soon. understands the listener, adapter thing much better than DrawingFun periods. working on it now, Will update when finished. 
- A lightweighted mediaplayer referenced from online to correct my weired way of coding for Android MediaPlayer. 
- took all the effort to make MyGLSurfaceView working with an seekbar. But I may still need a couple of hours to fix the rest minor bugs. But it worth trying for such a MediaPlayer for videos, as well as for correcting my MediaPlayer coding style. 
- got too tired today, especially in the late evening hours, don't want to work on it any more, but will work on it tomorrow without status reports, but will commit a relative-final version. 
- It has been a long day, good night, my beloved cousin~! good night online surfers. How am I going to pay my summer tuition fees?  God, I need a job so badly......
- 
- I am not proud of implementing multiple textures cause it's nothing original, but I feel happy that I could implement my app the way I originally wanted without cutting any features out, and building my confidence that as far as I want, I can find the way and do (/implement) it. 
- Todos: for following several hours, 
  - I may work on tune and fine the app to make the music I like, for examples the songs that I loved, "waiting for you", "(Everything I Do) I Do It For You (my beloved cousin)" etc.
  - Tomorrow once this one is done, I will focus on opengl 3d tetris, accompany with unity CA && WA elements building for practice (mainly through watching youtube videos). 
- The reason for choosing pictures: 
  - horse: my beloved cousin's birth year;
  - sheep: my birth year;
  - dog: my cousin has a dog, and I have a dog at home too, they should hang out sometime, while my cousin and I need to stay together. 
  - rabbit: my cousin and I both love this one a lot. 
  - butterfly: It suffers and eventually it becomes a beautiful butterfly~!
- Tetris theme music played by MediaPlayer can only function as the background music now. 
- Emacs + Auctex + org-mode can only export english correct with source codes, but can NOT export Chinese correctly from tex file yet. Need to find out the correct way to enable various kinds of latex engines from Auctex emacs mode. 
** May Love Last Forever
- Please don't get anything wrong, I always love my cousin, and as I can NOT make it any more clearer: *I will be right here in CA waiting for you.*
